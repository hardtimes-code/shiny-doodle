# Solar System Simulation

A Java Swing-based interactive simulation of the Solar System, featuring real planetary orbits, axis tilts, and a hypothetical planet Nibiru. The simulation allows you to visualize planetary motion, magnetic field disturbances, pole shifts, and more, with advanced user controls.

## Features

- Realistic orbits and axis tilts for all major planets
- Hypothetical Nibiru planet with user-triggered approach
- Visual effects for magnetic field and pole disturbances
- Time control: speed up, slow down, pause/resume
- Zoom in/out and focus on any planet
- Reset simulation at any time

## Controls

| Key/Button      | Action                                      |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Spacebar        | Pause/Resume simulation                     |
| + or =          | Zoom in                                     |
| -               | Zoom out                                    |
| → (Right Arrow) | Increase simulation speed                   |
| ← (Left Arrow)  | Decrease simulation speed                   |
| N               | Trigger Nibiru's approach                   |
| M               | Toggle magnetic field visualization         |
| R               | Reset simulation                            |
| 1–9             | Focus view on a specific planet             |
| GUI Buttons     | Pause/Resume, Zoom In, Zoom Out             |
